Cubic zirconia is the cubic crystalline form of zirconium dioxide. The synthesized material is hard and usually colorless, but may be made in a variety of different colors. 

Because of its low cost, durability, and close visual likeness to diamond, synthetic cubic zirconia has remained the most gemologically and economically important competitor for diamonds since commercial production began in 1976.

✨In Pre-Processing many techniques are used like outlier detection, missing value detection and also handled them.
✨Different visualizations and charts are implemented to support the findings of Exploratory Data Analysis.
✨As it was a Regression problem. We have used regression algorithm like Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
✨The ensemble model have performed well compared to that of linear Regression.
✨The best performance is given by Random Forest Regressor with accuracy of 97%.
